## Implementation Priority

**Start with Phase 1 (Memory Archive)** - This is the foundation that enables all other features and provides immediate value to users who want to track their emotional journey.

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Task 1.1** - Archive Infrastructure (Essential foundation)
2. **Task 1.2** - Cassette Shelf Visualization (Core user experience)
3. **Task 1.3** - Memory Playback (Therapeutic value)
4. **Task 2.1** - Mood Tagging (Emotional organization)
5. **Task 3.1** - Theme System (Personalization)

## Next Steps

The implementation plan is structured to build features incrementally:
- Each task is focused on specific coding activities
- Tasks reference specific requirements for validation
- Features build upon each other logically
- User experience remains smooth throughout development

**Ready to begin implementation!** Start with Task 1.1 (Archive Infrastructure) to lay the foundation for the memory archive system.
